        "ZAR": "\"Zhuangyuan Jiequ - Miniature Mansion\" is a WeChat AR mini-program developed based on the WeChat XR-Frame framework. " +
            "Users can scan the QR code to display vivid 3D animations of characters on corresponding markers. " +
            "This mini-program serves as an interactive experience project for scenic spots, " +
            "aiming to recreate the traditional life of ancient Chinese people in historical settings.",
        "BLA": "\"Bilian AI\" is a chat app targeted at Chinese AI users. " +
            "It integrates ChatGPT and WenyanYixin interfaces, providing an AI entrance accessible in mainland China. " +
            "I am responsible for the mobile frontend development of this application. " +
            "The frontend is built on the Flutter framework, enabling cross-platform synchronous development " +
            "for iOS and Android. It utilizes responsive layout and integrates related interfaces such as WeChat sharing.",
        "CCI": "Here is a showcase of all my coding assignments during the one-year UAL CCI master's program: " +
            "This includes JavaScript-related assignments from Coding 1, " +
            "OpenFrameworks and Python-related tasks from Coding 2, " +
            "and assignments related to neural networks from Coding 3.",
        "HPG": "Built with Vue3+Vite, featuring responsive layout and component-based development. " +
            "Utilizes Three.js for constructing 3D models and i18n for implementing internationalization of languages.",
        "CAT": "CatNet is an AR game that incorporates neural networks. " +
            "The game is developed using Unity, utilizing the Unity Barracuda plugin to deploy lightweight neural networks to mobile games. " +
            "It enables real-time recognition, classification, and feature extraction of real-life organisms using the smartphone camera through neural networks. " +
            "The obtained data is then used to programmatically generate corresponding 3D models. " +
            "This project serves as an experimental exploration of potential directions for future AR games. " +
            "It investigates the possibility of deploying lightweight models on mobile devices through mainstream game engines.",
        "GCS": "Chronoscape is an XR interactive game installation developed using the UE5 engine. " +
            "In this project, human existence is extended into a virtual digital world through gaming experiences. " +
            "Our goal is to design an immersive playground space that amplifies and commemorates the impact individuals have on the world. " +
            "The project is developed using Unreal Engine and incorporates a self-trained YOLO network deployed in the game through OpenCV and experimental neural network modules. " +
            "A camera positioned at the top tracks human traces in real-time within the scene and feeds back into the game environment."
